# GovHub Vulnerability Disclosure Process

We take security seriously at GovHub. This document explains how to report vulnerabilities and how we handle them. Our process is straightforward: **Report → Investigate → Fix → Disclose**.

## Report

If you discover a security issue, please email us at [lablivreunb@gmail.com](mailto:lablivreunb@gmail.com) or submit a [GitHub Security Vulnerability Report](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce it.
- The version or commit affected.
- If possible, suggested mitigations.

We will acknowledge your report within **5 business days**.

## Investigate

The GovHub maintainers will review the report, classify its severity, and decide on next steps:
- **Bug**: A normal bug, not a security issue.
- **Feature request**: The code works as intended, but new functionality is desired.
- **Security vulnerability**: An unintended behavior with security implications.

We’ll aim to classify and respond with our plan within **7 days** of acknowledgment.

## Fix

Confirmed vulnerabilities will be prioritized.  
High-severity issues will be fixed or mitigated as quickly as possible, typically within **7 days** of confirmation.

## Disclose

We prefer to **disclose responsibly**:
- Reporters are asked to give us up to **90 days** to fix before public disclosure.
- We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and give credit if desired.
- Public disclosure will be made through a **GitHub Security Advisory**.
